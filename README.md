# Second react project - random meme generator

App that generates random memes with the following features.

1. ImgFlip REST API integration
2. Styled-components with responsive design

(As stated in my previous project) styled-components is probably overkill for such a small project but again, my goal is to increase exposure to all the industry-standard tools.

I noticed a lot of the meme generating projects out there had 2 fixed textboxes - one at the top, one at the bottom. But this is quite an inconvenience as most memes out there have more than 2 text fields with varying positions. Take for example the Two Buttons meme - there are 3 textfields and 2 of them are located on the button and 1 on the sweating man.

This is why I decided to integrate a POST request so that users would be able to generate a proper meme for them to save.
